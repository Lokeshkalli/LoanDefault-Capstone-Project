# LoanDefault-Capstone-Project


## Project Overview

This project focuses on **risk analytics** within the **banking and financial services** sector, specifically investigating the risk of loan defaults. The objective is to understand how different variables and factors influence loan default tendencies and to propose insights that can help **lending institutions** minimize the risk of financial loss while lending.

The analysis explores multiple aspects of loan data, including the impact of variables such as:

- **Loan type**
- **Loan purpose**
- **Business or commercial nature**
- **Credit score**
- **Upfront charges**
- **Loan amount**
- **Interest rates**
- **Property values**

By examining the correlations between these variables and loan default rates, this study seeks to uncover patterns and tendencies that are important for improving risk assessment strategies in lending institutions.
